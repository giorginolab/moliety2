            comment: "An atom which is not triply bonded and not one-connected i.e.terminal connected by a single non-ring bond to an equivalent atom. Note that logical operators can be applied to bonds (\"-&!@\"). Here, the overall SMARTS consists of two atoms and one bond. The bond is \"site and not ring\". *#* any atom triple bonded to any atom.  By enclosing this SMARTS in parentheses and preceding with $, this enables us to use $(*#*) to write a recursive SMARTS using that string as an atom primitive. The purpose is to avoid bonds such as c1ccccc1-C#C which would be considered rotatable without this specification."
